# Tea Factory Management System(MVC Architecture concepts)

Welcome to the MVC Architecture project! This project is developed for Tea Factory Management System using MVC Architecture concepts
## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the principles of MVC architecture, a common architectural pattern used in software development. The project showcases the separation of concerns and modularity by dividing the application into distinct layers.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit 11 (JDK) installed.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Git for version control.
- MySQL or another relational database management system installed.

### Database Setup

1. **Create Database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Tfms;
   ```

2. **Run SQL Script:**
   Locate the SQL file named `init_database.sql` in the `resources` folder. Run this script in your MySQL client to initialize the database with required tables and data.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Build and run the application.
